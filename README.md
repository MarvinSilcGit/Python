# Algorithms to be solved
The goal is SOLVING many algotithms in Python and show for anyone who wants by aiding me with CV and learning with logic programming and tests.

The source of the algorithms is on source code of each algorithm

The source of the algorithms (the challenge don't the source code) of 2018-2019 folder came from book: COUTINHO, Nilo Ney. Introdução à programação com Python. NovaTec, 2014.

Not all the algorithms will be remade at 2021 folder. However, fews will be remodeled in order to improve the readability, redundancy and consistency without change the original structure. Furthermore, the algorithms more challenging will be remade for sure.

Further: the algorithms with "incompleto" on name surely will be remade

Last but no least: all these assumptions can be changed over the time;
